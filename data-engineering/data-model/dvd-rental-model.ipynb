    "### What’s data model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Its an abstract representation about how data is organized and renationalized \n",
    "\n",
    "### ACID\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atomicity - Treat every transaction as a single operation\n",
    "- Consistency - Data does not suffer changes from start to end transaction, its always consistent\n",
    "- Isolation - Any reads or writes should not affect separate transactions, even when they occur simultaneously\n",
    "- Durability - Once transaction is done, the data must persist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational model\n",
    "\n",
    "Organize data through table, row columns and primary key, and foreign keys that links tables \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adventages of using ralational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- JOINS availability\n",
    "- Smaller data volumes\n",
    "- Flexibility of queries\n",
    "- ACID (Allows data integrity)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s data warehouse?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a unified repository for all data that is collected from all the different company sources\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data In and Data out\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data in (Operational process)\n",
    "    - OLTP (Online Transactional processing)\n",
    "- Data out (Analytical process)\n",
    "    - OLAP (Online Analytical processing)\n",

    "### Star model\n",
    "\n",
    "A star schema is used to denormalize business data into dimensions (like time and product) and facts (like transactions in amounts and quantities).\n",
    "\n",
    "A star schema has a single fact table in the center, containing business \"facts\" (like transaction amounts and quantities). The fact table connects to multiple other dimension tables along \"dimensions\" like time, or product. Star schemas enable users to slice and dice the data however they see fit, typically by joining two or more fact tables and dimension tables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://www.databricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/star-schema-erd.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Denormalize schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "Star schemas denormalize the data, which means adding redundant columns to some dimension tables to make querying and working with the data faster and easier.\n",
    "The purpose is to trade some redundancy (duplication of data) in the data model for increased query speed, by avoiding computationally expensive join operations.\n",
    "In this model, the fact table is normalized but the dimensions tables are not. That is, data from the fact table exists only on the fact table, but dimensional tables may hold redundant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Fact/dimensional models like star schemas are simple to understand and implement, and make it easy for end users to find the data they need. They can be applied to data marts and other data resources.\n",
    "    - Great for simple queries because of their reduced dependency on joins when accessing the data, as compared to normalized models like snowflake schemas.\n",
    "    - Adapt well to fit OLAP models.\n",
    "    - Improved query performance as compared to normalized data, because star schemas attempt to avoid computationally expensive joins.\n",
    "    - Dimensional analysis\n",
